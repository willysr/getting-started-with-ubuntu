What problems do they need to solve? How are they controlled?

The first course will dive into these questions, introducing you to the **basics of robotics**, with an overview on the robotsâ€™ components, modeling, and main problems to solve to achieve a fully autonomous system.

The **main goal** is to provide you the main insights to understand the **robotics hardware and software** available and get you comfortable in working with a robotics system capable of executing tasks in a real environment.

To reinforce your learning, short quizzes and exercises will be available at the end of each module, including analyzing existing robotic systems.

Robotics is still an open research area and many researchers around the world are contributing to its progress. Additional resources are included to further explore and deepen the topics covered in this course.
